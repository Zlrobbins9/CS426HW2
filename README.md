Brief game idea: Players play as cats and transfer mice (memory) to other players to represent memory traveling through computer architecture. 

Player Interaction Pattern: Cooperative play; cats can work together to clear out the mice faster than with just one player, and therefore coordination is key.

Objective: Transfer mice from one pool of memory to another.
 
Serious Objective: Help players understand how memory travels through a computer system.

Procedures: Cats pick up mice in home memory pool. Then transfer mice to other memory pools to other players.

Conflict: th mice can escape your grasp and potentially fall off the map (obstacle)

Boundaries: the confines of the computer system shaped map.

Rules: Cannot drop mice off the map 

Resources: Time, the mice

Outcome: the player learns the way different aspects of a computer system are connected.

Non-plain-vanilla procedure/rule (see the Hw02 handout for what would qualify as an unusual procedure/rule): Being able to pick up mice, and those mice can escape from your grasp if you take too long

How this fits the theme: The player characters are cats that drag around mice, which fulfills the cat theme. In addition, The area is shaped like a computer diagram with a one to one connection between moving mice between spots and moving data between pools. 

Test Question for Serious Objective: Are all memory pools directly connected?

Expected Correct Answer for Serious Objective: No, all memory pools are exclusively indirectly connected.
